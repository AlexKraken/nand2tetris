In progress project files for Coursera's Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nand to Tetris I &amp; II

[Nand to Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) has been unbelievably helpful for filling in the many gaps from my college courses. Fair warning that this code is currently in *rough* shape as I'm still trying to make sure I understand the concepts; as such, it's at the point of barely passing all the assigned tests. After I'm convinced I know the material better, I will spend time on refactoring so it's less of an eyesore.
